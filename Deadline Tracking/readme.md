- 1 = Research NOV 21st

Task 1

-<em> As a team, it is time to start thinking about the research questions you need to ask in relation to your project idea(s). As a team, you should discuss the following: </em>

    - your main research questions and how you intend to answer them
    - the modalities and methodologies that are most useful for your area of interest
    - how will you document, share and disseminate this information.

-<em> Prepare and share with the team:</em>

    - a list of research questions
    - an outline of modalities and methodologies
    - a list of documents that will be shared and disseminated.
    - Make sure that you are all accountable for actioning these things. Remember to reflect as you go!

- 2 = Dec 12 (project outline)
    - Team, how will we write a proposal, which part of the project is interesting, how to describe deliverables, how to evaluate failure
    - Individual, Main headings of Project Proposal Outline, Deliverable Components, Techniques for evaluating.
    - Agree on one solution for all above :)

    12. 8000 words, opens on December 19th (5 weeks)
- 3= jan 2
    - As a team, use this time to start to work on the core features of your software application. You might want to institute this as a sprint (e.g. one week, two weeks) or to define more clearly steps and stages of development using a different iterative strategy.
    - Make sure you think about communication and collaboration including things like ownership of tasks and prioritisation of deliverables. Try to document your process as you go.
- 4 = jan 16
    - In your team, design and run some tests on your software.
    
    The outcomes of this activity are:
    
    - keeping a record of the tests and the feedback you have received from testing
    - a list of aspects that work well i.e. parts of the system that meet certain criteria
    - a list of aspects that might need tweaking or changing based on the feedback from your tests.
    - Remember, not all tests are created equal! Your tests may be about getting an expected input, reaching a state in a given threshold or timeframe, or may be to do with how components of your system interact and pass data around. This all depends on the application that you are building but should be well justified.
- 5 = Jan 30
    
    **Task 1**
    
    In your team, design and run some tests on your software. You might want to use functional tests, user tests or a mix of both.
    
    **Task 2**
    
    Reflect on the feedback you have received from your tests. How can you conceptualise this under a broader set of constraints? Can you quantify or group the feedback in some meaningful way for analysis?
    
    Consider aspects that work well and others that might need tweaking or changing.
    
    Testing will make up a big portion of your report (and your marks) so test thoroughly! You might want to reflect back on Chapters 8 and 9 of the course textbook for this exercise.
    
- 6 = Feb 13
    
    **Task 1**
    
    In your team, think about your project:
    
    - is there any potential for hurt or harm?
    - what sort of demographic are you aiming for?
    - are there any ‘at risk’ users?
    - how might you design your software to support people and keep them safe?
    - if the system were to cause harm to an individual, what do you think the personal and professional impact might be?
    
    Try to conceptualise your ideas in some way. Perhaps you want to produce a table of these issues and then code them according to things like severity.
    
- 7 = end of course! march 13

- 
- Speak about submission,
- Build ‘requirement list’ for a simple project (10 points)
- Prioritise
